# dualstruder
Simple Dual-Extrusion upgrade
This is a an attempt to build a simple dualstrusion mechanism, using a single motor and single hot end.

The idea was to provide with a simple upgrade possibility to many people who have a single extrusion setup. And keeping the cost low and fun high while at it!!

Right now i am designing for a direct-drive setup. But this can be easily modified for a Bowden type extrusion setup.

Also for the cooler, I am using an aluminium block with a heat-sink. (custom design)
but if you wanted to use a E3D v6, simple modifications could be done.

Assumed limitations:

filament is wasted trying to avoid contamination.
print time is increased because it uses a single hot end.
The setup being designed consists of:

Nema 17 stepper, being used for Direct drive extruder.
MK8 SS drive. (9mm x 11mm - effective dia 6.8mm)
1 of 624zz bearing each for the two idlers.
Some spring or rubber band for tension on the idler arms.
Standard size RC servo (~40 gms)
Code modifications are not done yet. I work on Marlin and I am working on the modifications right now.

UPDATE: upload of the cam and an updated Servo mount.

It would be great if people here came to my support and commented. do warn me of design flaws if you see one.
